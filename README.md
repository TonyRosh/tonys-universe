# tonys-universe
A 3D universe built in THREE.js showcasing my entire life through picture cubes suspended in space by UFOS. This project is kind of heavy and clunky at the moment, some slower computers may not be able to support it, and it's not supported on mobile yet. It was fun to learn the ways of THREE.js though!
